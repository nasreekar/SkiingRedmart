# Skiing in Singapore - a coding diversion
This is my solution for the [challenge](http://geeks.redmart.com/2015/01/07/skiing-in-singapore-a-coding-diversion/). It is done using Java

## Problem
To find the longest (and then steepest) path on the 1000x1000 map with numbers ranging between 0 and 1500.

## Conclusion
This may not be the most optimum solution for this question. But I tried to solve it somehow and it was fun to solve it.
